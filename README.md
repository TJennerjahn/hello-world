# hello-world
Test repository following the GitHub guide

Hi everyone!

I'm a CS student from germany and this is my first venture into the world of version control.
Most often I turn caffeine into C#, but recently I've played around with android and java (and a little bit of Kotlin) and felt the need to let GitHub take care of all my backup needs.

Also, GitHub has a great educational package that allows me to have unlimited private repos without paying anything and who am I to turn down free stuff?
